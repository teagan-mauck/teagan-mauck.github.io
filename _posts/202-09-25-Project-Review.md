*Photogrammar* is a digital humanities project that organizes the 170,000 photos taken by the United States Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information (FSA-OWI) between 1935 and 1945. These photos highlight the everyday life of rural and working-class Americans during the Great Depression and World War II. Photographers traveled across the US to capture the poorest parts of America affected by President Roosevelt’s controversial [Resettlement Administration](https://livingnewdeal.org/glossary/resettlement-administration-ra-1935/), which resulted in the iconic and timeless images we associate with the Great Depression and World War II today.

This 3-part interactive project focuses on a mapping project, which organizes photos by both photographer and county. The mapping project uses Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, and mapbox as its primary software. Combined, these allow for audiences to get a glimpse into 1930s life in a way that words cannot express. I spent hours looking through dozens of photos of my hometown, and was shocked at how different the landscape looked without as many cars. Most individual photos have the original description, photographer name, the approximate date and location where the photo was taken, and how it's classified.

The classification system was originally implemented in 1942, but exists in a digital form as part of the project. This allows audiences to look through the photo collection based on themes, such as [homes and living conditions](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/labs/treemap/). Not every photo has the same amount of information, and some tagged locations vary dramatically from where originally listed. 

Unfortunately, *Photogrammar's* progress has been halted indefinitely. There are two other half-finished projects within *Photogrammar*, and the corresponding blog hasn't been updated since 2013. [These two projects](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/labs/) would have given new audiences a chance to interact with photo characteristics and metadata in unique and exciting ways. I enjoyed exploring the different relationships between photographers and their subjects in California via the now-abandoned Metadata Dashboard, and wish this project in particular had developed more. The Metadata Dashboard was also aesthetically pleasing, whereas the rest of the project was very straightforward, but incredibly plain.

This project includes hyperlinks that connect audiences to an even larger collection, courtesy of the Library of Congress (LOC). These photos were considered government work in the 1930s and 40s, so the LOC has every negative, misprint, and photobomb. Although the LOC digitized most of the collection, *Photogrammar* allows for the public to access these photos in a straightforward and easy-to-navigate platform. There's a link to the information about seeing the collection in person as well, which is now on my bucket list. 

The only link in the entire project that does not work is the link to the Primary Investigator’s professional page via Yale University. I have a feeling that she no longer works for the university, which is also why this project is at a standstill. However, there are seven other people listed as contributors, so hopefully this project will continue to develop at some point in the future. 

Although pictures speak a thousand words, I wish this project had more information about the history of the FSA-OWI, and about the photographers themselves. These photographers have taken photos that the general public associates with hard times and resiliency, and including their personal experiences would add another dimension to this project. As a whole, *Photogrammar* is a fascinating project that brings old photos from a crucial part of America's history into new light.
