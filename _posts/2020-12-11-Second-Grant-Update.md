**Grant Writing Process #2!**

Wow, what a semester! As I finalize my grant project and turn other assignments in for this class, I’m realizing more and more how much I underestimate myself. I didn’t think I was creative enough to come up with a digital humanities project on my own, nor did I think I was skilled enough to write a comprehensive grant package in order to receive funding for said project. This grant project helped me push my own academic boundaries and realize that I am way more talented than I give myself credit for. 

As mentioned before, my project is an interactive map that follows the seven countries that passed, and later repealed, Prohibition legislation around the same time the US did. These six countries, other than the US, are Canada, Russia, Finland, Norway, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands in Denmark. I’m focusing specifically on bootlegging, and how the illegalization of alcohol doesn’t change the consumption of alcohol in society, and leads to a rise of organized crime and financial problems. At the time of my first blog post, I still hadn’t ironed out all the details for my project, but now I’m more organized and almost finished with my grant!
