**Grant Writing Process #2!**

Wow, what a semester! As I finalize my grant project and turn other assignments in for this class, I’m realizing more and more how much I underestimate myself. I didn’t think I was creative enough to come up with a digital humanities project on my own, nor did I think I was skilled enough to write a comprehensive grant package in order to receive funding for said project. This grant project helped me push my own academic boundaries and realize that I am way more talented than I give myself credit for. 

As mentioned before, my project is an interactive map that follows the seven countries that passed, and later repealed, Prohibition legislation around the same time the US did. These six countries, other than the US, are Canada, Russia, Finland, Norway, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands in Denmark. I’m focusing specifically on bootlegging, and how the illegalization of alcohol doesn’t change the consumption of alcohol in society, and leads to a rise of organized crime and financial problems. At the time of my first blog post, I still hadn’t ironed out all the details for my project, but now I’m more organized and almost finished with my grant! 


Due to rather odd circumstances, I was on a plane for a combined 8 hours right after Thanksgiving, which gave me a dedicated amount of time to work on my grant with no distractions. I finished my bibliography, perfected my environmental scan, and wrote about 80% of my grant narrative. I kept overthinking the grant narrative and environmental scan, which led me to procrastinate and further fueled my anxiety. The grant project seemed really daunting, but dedicating most of the day to writing and having nothing else to do helped ease my anxiety.

I was looking back on tweets from earlier this semester, and laughed at the progression of brainstorming, excitement, and pure panic that was this grant writing process. 

My budget was fairly straightforward, but the next major mental hurdle was perfecting my resume. I took advantage of my professor’s extended office hours so we could review my writing pieces together, as well as give me some pointer regarding my resume. I’ve had an updated resume since I started working at 16, but most of my work experience has been either working at my hometown’s movie theater, or working with children. I was concerned that I didn’t have enough relevant experiences in order to fill out a resume for the grant, but my professor told me to focus on strong verbs that highlight critical thinking, design, and teaching experience. Just because I don’t have published articles or digital humanities projects, doesn’t mean I lack skills that would be beneficial in writing a grant. For example, I help design science curricula for 4th and 5th graders in order to boost test scores, which has elements of all the desired skills my professor talked about. 

I also traveled a lot during my gap year between high school and college, but I wasn’t sure how to include that in my resume. Since my project is about Prohibition in parts of Europe, I wanted to somehow capture my travels in Europe in my resume. I learned that including a personal interests section in your resume not only increases the human aspect of your grant, but also can help expound on why you’re interested in creating that project in particular. 

I was caught off-guard when my professor praised my writing and told me that I’ll be just fine with the assignment. I don’t see myself as a particularly strong writer, especially when it comes to academic writing. This grant project, and class overall, have helped me develop some confidence with writing at the collegiate level, and I'm grateful for it. I really enjoyed the grant writing process, and I think it will come in handy with my intended career goals later in life.
