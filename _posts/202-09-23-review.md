Photogrammar is a digital humanities project that organizes the 170,000 photos taken by the United States Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information (FSA-OWI) between 1935 and 1945. These photos highlight the everyday life of rural and working-class Americans during the Great Depression and World War II. President Roosevelt sent photographers to every corner of the US, to help garner empathy and support for controversial legislation which affected the third-poorest part of America. Many of the iconic photos we think of from the Great Depression belong to this collection. 

This 3-part interactive project focuses on a mapping project, which organizes photos taken by photographer, and by county. The mapping project uses Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, and mapbox as its primary software. Only 90,000 of the photos have a location specified, so not every photo has the same amount of information. Some of the tagged locations aren't exact, with one being over 100 miles from where it's listed. Each individual photo has the original description, the photographer name, the approximate date and location where the photo was taken, and how it is classified. On top of having an interactive map, Photogrammar has also digitized the in-depth classification system that was originally implemented in 1942, which allows the audience to look through photo collections by theme.
