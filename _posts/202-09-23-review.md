Photogrammar is a digital humanities project that organizes the 170,000 photos taken by the United States Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information (FSA-OWI) between 1935 and 1945. These photos highlight the everyday life of rural and working-class Americans during the Great Depression and World War II. Photographers traveled across the US to capture the poorest parts of America affected by President Rooseveltâ€™s controversial [Resettlement Administration](https://livingnewdeal.org/glossary/resettlement-administration-ra-1935/). This collection resulted in iconic and timeless images we associate with the Great Depression and World War II today. 

This 3-part interactive project focuses on a mapping project, which organizes photos both by photographer, and by county. The mapping project uses Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, and mapbox as its primary software. Only 90,000 of the photos have a location specified, so not every photo has the same amount of information. Some of the tagged locations aren't exact, with one being over 100 miles off from where it's listed. Each individual photo has the original description, the photographer name, the approximate date and location where the photo was taken, and how it's classified. The classification system was originally implemented in 1942, but exists in a digital form as part of the project. This allows audiences to look through the photo collection based on themes, such as [homes and living conditions](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/labs/treemap/).
