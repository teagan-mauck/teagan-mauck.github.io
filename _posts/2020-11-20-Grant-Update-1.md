**Grant Writing Process Update!** 

For my final assignment, I am responsible for writing a grant proposal package for a digital humanities project. Although my professor created this fictional $1500 grant for instructional purposes only, and I’m not required to create the actual project, I’m still intimidated by the grant-writing process. This grant proposal is made up of six writing pieces, most notably a grant narrative and environmental scan. 

My project is an interactive timeline/mapping project that focuses on the seven countries that passed, and later repealed, Prohibition laws in the 20th century. Even though my professor set no limits on project topics, I was still drawing a blank on ideas. As I was explaining the history behind the India Pale Ale to my less-than-impressed husband one night, I came up with the perfect project. I was going to create a mapping project that explored the global history of alcohol. My dad and I used to brew beer during the summer, and I have always been fascinated by the history and science behind alcohol. This project seemed like an instant hit. 

My professor was the voice of reason, and helped me narrow my topic down to something more manageable.  At my project proposal meeting, she gently reminded me that the grant was only for $1500, and needed to be created by me, a third-year undergrad with little graphic design experience. I narrowed my project down to analyzing seven countries that passed, then repealed, Prohibition laws around the same time the US did. I discovered a handful of projects about the American Prohibition, but none that focused on other movements occurring at the time. Prohibition is a defining feature of the Roaring 20s in the US, but laws like this affected alcohol consumption, organized crime, and led to the rise of bootlegging in other countries, as well.

I’ve spent hours clicking through this interactive project, put together by [The Mob Museum](http://prohibition.themobmuseum.org/?_ga=2.114784199.1330961981.1605928736-387512693.1603765982#Home) in Las Vegas, Nevada. At some point, I would like to work on a project of this magnitude, but with a larger budget.  

My first assignment was to complete an environmental scan and bibliography for peer review. My bibliography is coming together well, albeit a bit short. I get so distracted by going down the rabbit hole of research that I forget to cite where I got my information.  I'd like to find two or three more sources before submitting it. 

My environmental scan, however, was a disaster. Even though my professor provided a sample for us, and spent many classes outlining her expectations, I still did poorly. There aren’t many American Prohibition DH projects, and I haven't found any on other countries. Writing an environmental scan proved difficult, because I don’t have a ton of projects to talk about. I received some incredible feedback from a classmate, and I'm working on rewriting it for a second round of peer reviews in a week.  I’m equal parts nervous and grateful that my professor won’t see all my writing until mid-December, because I definitely have a long way to go.

These past 2 classes have been beyond helpful for me. My confidence took a hit after writing my environmental scan, and I was terrified for the grant narrative. My professor went through her sample documents paragraph by paragraph, to compare how the two differed. Seeing both sample documents side-by-side helped me see where my shortcomings were with my environmental scan, and where to start with my grant narrative. I took copious notes, and they have been more than beneficial for my second draft of my environmental scan, and my first draft of my grant narrative.  

I plan on spending a dedicated amount of time focusing on the environmental scan and grant narrative over Thanksgiving break. I am also responsible for an itemized list, but that seems pretty straightforward. My goal is to have four writing documents that I'm proud of (grant narrative, environmental scan, budget, and bibliography) by our next peer review session.
