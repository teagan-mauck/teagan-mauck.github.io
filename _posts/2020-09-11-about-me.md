## “If we wait until we’re ready…”

“... we’ll be waiting for the rest of our lives.” This quote by Lemony Snicket, the author of _A Series of Unfortunate Events_, sums up my feelings about digital humanities, and life in general. There is no universal “right time” to start a movement, or create something you’re proud of, or pursue your passions wholeheartedly. More often than not, you are the only one stopping yourself from achieving greatness.

My name is Teagan Mauck, and I am a third year student at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia.  I graduated from Thomas Nelson Community College in May 2020 with an Associate of Arts in Liberal Arts, after taking a gap year between high school and college.  At Thomas Nelson, I was inducted into [Phi Theta Kappa](https://www.ptk.org/), an international honor society specifically for community colleges. I also was given an opportunity to further my academic writing and narrow down my interests. 

From the time I was a freshman in high school until now, I have changed career goals at least a dozen times. At one point, I wanted to be an ER doctor, but after spending a summer in a Ghanaian hospital right before my senior year of high school, I realized that handling car accidents, burns, and infections for 12 hours a day wasn't my idea of fun.

My ultimate goal, as of now, is to work for an organization or department that specializes in tackling disinformation and "fake news" campaigns. The concept of propaganda has always fascinated me, and I think that the easiest way to mold a society's opinions is to control the flow of information. This is incredibly dangerous in the 21st century, when information is so easily accessible. I plan on going to graduate school, but not right after graduating from CNU. I move around a lot, and would like to get experience doing a variety of different things before choosing a graduate program. 

One of my dreams is to help orchestrate a TEDx event. I gave a [TEDx talk in 2016](https://youtu.be/usqKpe2RoZk) through my high school, and loved every second of it, from the planning stages to actually speaking on stage. I think everyone has a unique story to tell, and TEDx events help to share those stories. 

I currently work as a “Mad Scientist” at [Mad Science of Hampton Roads](https://hamptonroads.madscience.org/), a science enrichment organization dedicated to help children learn about science through hands-on and interactive programs. I tell everyone that I’m basically Bill Nye the Science Guy, but instead of Bill, I go by Teaganasaurus-Rex, or T-Rex for short. I love working with children and public speaking, so giving fun presentations about dry ice or air pressure to dozens of children is the best job ever. 

I’m originally from Monterey, California, and moved to Virginia about two years ago. I live with my husband, who’s also a California native, and my cat named Hollie, who’s the true love of my life.
