Photogrammar is a digital humanities project that organizes the 170,000 photos taken by the United States Farm Security Administration and the Office of War Information (FSA-OWI) between 1935 and 1945. These photos highlight the everyday life of rural and working-class Americans during the Great Depression and World War II. Photographers traveled across the US to capture the poorest parts of America affected by President Rooseveltâ€™s controversial [Resettlement Administration](https://livingnewdeal.org/glossary/resettlement-administration-ra-1935/). This collection resulted in iconic and timeless images we associate with the Great Depression and World War II today.

This 3-part interactive project focuses on a mapping project, which organizes photos by both photographer and county. The mapping project uses Leaflet, OpenStreetMap, and mapbox as its primary software. This tool allows for audiences to get a glimpse into 1930s life in a way that words cannot express. I looked through dozens of photos from my hometown, and was shocked at how different the landscape looked without as many cars. Most individual photos have the original description, the photographer name, the approximate date and location where the photo was taken, and how it's classified.

The classification system was originally implemented in 1942, but exists in a digital form as part of the project. This allows audiences to look through the photo collection based on themes, such as [homes and living conditions](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/labs/treemap/). Not every photo has the same amount of information, and some tagged locations vary dramatically from where originally listed. 

Unfortunately, Photogrammar's progress has been halted indefinitely. Its corresponding blog hasn't been updated since 2013, and there are two half-finished projects within Photogrammar. [These two projects](http://photogrammar.yale.edu/labs/) would have given new audiences a chance to interact with photo characteristics and metadata in new ways. I enjoyed exploring the different relationships between photographers and their subjects in California via the now-abandoned Metadata Dashboard, and wish this project in particular had developed more. The Metadata Dashboard was also aesthetically pleasing, whereas the rest of the project was very straightforward, but incredibly plain.

Although pictures speak a thousand words, I wish this project had more information about the history of the Farm Security Administration/Office of War Information, and about the photographers themselves. These photographers have taken photos that the general public associates with hard times and resiliency, and including their personal experiences would add another dimension to this project.
