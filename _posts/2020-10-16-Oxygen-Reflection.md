**Adventures in TEI**

I was assigned a portion of “The Yellow Wall-paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson to code by using TEI, or Text Encoding Initiative. “The Yellow Wall-paper” is a semi-autobiographical account written in 1892 about Stetson’s own battle with postpartum psychosis. I was in charge of using Oxygen, an easy-to-use XML (eXtensive Markup language) editor, to analyze and mark up the second column of the text on page 655.

We first copied our portions of the manuscript into Google Drive, and used the comments feature to take note of where certain features of the text were located. Stetson breaks up her writing into several paragraphs; my section alone had 21! I also noticed that in my section, there were a lot of em-dashes. The section I was given is toward the very end of the story, where the main character decides to lock herself in her room and tear down all the wallpaper in a hallucination-filled frenzy. The short, choppy paragraphs and extended pauses make sense in this section, as it is the main character’s stream of consciousness. I wanted to make sure I captured that the best way I could via TEI.
