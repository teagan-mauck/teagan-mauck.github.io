**Adventures in TEI**

I was assigned a portion of “The Yellow Wall-paper” by Charlotte Perkins Stetson to code by using TEI, or Text Encoding Initiative. “The Yellow Wall-paper” is a semi-autobiographical account written in 1892 about Stetson’s own battle with postpartum psychosis. I was in charge of using Oxygen, an easy-to-use XML (eXtensive Markup language) editor, to analyze and mark up the second column of the text on page 655.

We first copied our portions of the manuscript into Google Drive, and used the comments feature to take note of where certain features of the text were located. Stetson breaks up her writing into several paragraphs; my section alone had 21! I also noticed that in my section, there were a lot of em-dashes. The section I was given is toward the very end of the story, where the main character decides to lock herself in her room and tear down all the wallpaper in a hallucination-filled frenzy. The short, choppy paragraphs and extended pauses make sense in this section, as it is the main character’s stream of consciousness. I wanted to make sure I captured that the best way I could via TEI.

We spent several class periods troubleshooting Oxygen. It looked incredibly intimidating at first, but after a brief tutorial led by my professor, I picked it up rather quickly. Working with Oxygen was much simpler than I had anticipated, especially since we only had to work with a handful of tags, which are ways to mark the text characteristics. I realized that the main reason I was intimidated was because Oxygen had already included tags in my file like ```<titleStmt> </titlestmt>``` which just meant I had to fill in the blanks. I enjoyed the organization of the program, and how each tag was nestled inside a bigger one. It made a lot of sense to me, as I take handwritten notes in a very similar fashion. Instead of arrows and bullet points, I had ```<body></body>``` and ```<p></p>```

 The concept of coding can be pretty daunting, and I’ve heard horror stories from some friends studying computer science, but using Oxygen to validate my TEI code made it straightforward and simple. I caught on pretty fast, but kept second-guessing myself because I thought there was no way using Oxygen could be this easy. 

The only part I struggled with was the italics tag. Whenever I entered the tag that was given to me, Oxygen underlined my portion in red, signaling that my code was invalid. When I brought this up to my professor, she sent me a code that looked identical to the one I was using. Hers worked, however, and I’m still not sure why. My guess is that I was accidentally adding or removing a necessary character from the tag, without realizing it.

As much as I enjoyed the coding process, my seven year old laptop definitely did not. It crashed right as I was finishing my code, and took over an hour to restart. Thankfully, I’ve learned to save my file as I work on it, so not too much was lost. However, my laptop decided not to save my coded portion of “The Yellow Wall-paper” as any type of file extension. All the programs I’ve ever used have saved my files automatically with something at the end like .pdf or .png, but Oxygen didn’t save it as anything. When I checked my saved files, my code came up as a “MAUCK Document,” because I saved my file as “pg655.2.Mauck.” I managed to save it it's the correct form eventually, but my laptop definitely did not make it easy. 

Overall, I enjoyed this project immensely. I learned not to be intimidated by an unknown computer program, and to trust myself when using said computer program. I think the way I take notes helped with my understanding of tags and the overall organization of TEI. I learned pretty quickly that attention to detail will make or break a line of code, and the smallest error will result in an invalidated code that will not work. I’m looking forward to using this type of program again, perhaps with my own personal DH project in the future.
